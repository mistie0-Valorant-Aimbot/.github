Let’s be real — Valorant isn’t just about aim, it’s about **insane aim**. Every peek, every pixel, every millisecond matters. If your crosshair isn’t glued to heads, you're losing rounds. But what if you didn’t need to grind 1000 hours just to hit Immortal flicks?

That’s where the **Valorant Aimbot** comes in — a tool that locks targets with surgical precision, adjusts your shots naturally, and boosts your performance so hard, you’ll feel like TenZ with wallhacks. Whether you're playing for clout or just trying to escape Bronze hell, this aimbot will *carry* you through every ranked lobby.

## 🔫 What Is Valorant Aimbot?

A Valorant aimbot is a cheat script or tool that automates aiming functions to give you perfect accuracy. It reads enemy locations and moves your crosshair for you — either instantly (rage) or smoothly (legit).

You can customize how it behaves:

* Aim only when you press a key 🔒
* Limit it to headshots 💥
* Set a specific FOV circle 🎯
* Or make it look completely human 👀

It’s stealthy, deadly, and surprisingly customizable.
